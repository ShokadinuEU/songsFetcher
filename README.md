### Fetch Song App

#### To build this app I've use the CLI create-react-app

- Since I can't send a file with certain extension via mail I'll use GitHub to share my code.

- So in order to get the code you have to get to cmd and type:

  - "git clone https://github.com/ShokadinuEU/songsFetcher.git song_fetcher"

  - after clone the project just use cd song_fetcher to switch to the folder where it was cloned.

  - and then to install the react modules use "npm install"

  - then to start the project use "npm start" and voila, you have the project up and running localy

* Then as was mentioned on the instruction, you can fetch the data from API by clicking on the button | Go! |

##### + Sorry for my Poor Design, I was concentrate on functionality.
