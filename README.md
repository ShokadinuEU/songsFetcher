### Fetch Song App

#### To build this app I've use the CLI create-react-app

- So by using the CLI from react I've compiled the project with the buil in command npm run build

- And by dooing so in order to acces the code you just need to use "npm install" followed by "npm start"

* Then as was mentioned on the instruction, you can fetch the data from API by clicking on the button | Go! |

##### + Sorry for my Poor Design, I was concentrate on functionality.
